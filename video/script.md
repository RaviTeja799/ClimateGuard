## INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

**[HOOK - Show dramatic climate visual]**

"Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. But here's the problem: most people want to help, but they don't know how. Personal carbon footprints feel abstract, overwhelming, and impossible to track."

**[Transition to solution]**

"What if you had a personal AI coach that understands YOUR lifestyle, calculates your REAL impact, and creates actionable plans you can actually follow?"

"Introducing ClimateGuard - your AI-powered carbon footprint companion."

## PROBLEM DEEP DIVE (0:30 - 0:50)

**[Show statistics on screen]**

- "The average American produces 16 tons of CO2 per year"
- "That's 4x the global average"
- "But 73% of people say they don't know their actual carbon footprint"

**[Show frustration points]**

"Current solutions fail because they're:
- One-size-fits-all
- No personalization
- No memory of your progress
- No community support"
